******************************DEGREE AUDIT NOTES******************************
**TUTORIAL: To familiarize yourself with the new degree audit functionality, please review the "Interpreting a Degree
Audit" tutorial, found on the student Help page: http://lionpathsupport.psu.edu/help/undergraduateparent/, as well as in the
LionPATH Online Library for Faculty & Staff.**
**NOTE: A considerable portion of course substitutions and exceptions that were entered in the former audit system will
need to be re-entered into LionPATH. Staff entering college exceptions are actively working through student audits to
review and re-apply, where applicable, substitutions and exceptions that were previously approved.**
**HAVE QUESTIONS/FOUND AN ISSUE? The following reporting lines of communication should be followed:
-if a student has a question, they should communicate with their academic advisor;
-if an academic advisor or other faculty/staff member has a question, they should communicate with their college's degree
audit contact. This contact is often a campus registrar or college records coordinator, and is the person in the college that
has been coordinating the audit validation process with LionPATH; and
-the college degree audit contact should address the question/report the issue to their designated contact in the Office of
the University Registrar who will work towards a resolution.**

This report is an unofficial working copy of a student's progress.
Graduation certification of degree requirements is subject to the approval of the student's college dean. Questions about
the report should be directed to the student's academic adviser or college dean.
