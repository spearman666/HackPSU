# HackPSU
AI on-demand tool for students and advisers to integrate to LionPath
We created a ChatBot for Penn State that is capable of telling students how many credits they need to graduate, or for a specific gen ed, and is a stepping stone to be created into something amazing for all of Penn State to use.
We implement Firebase with a student's Academic Requirements page (after massive amounts of text mining) to be a little Academic Advisor that will save all conversations into a dynamic database that will have a sentimental anylises on it to undersatnd how students are feeling?
